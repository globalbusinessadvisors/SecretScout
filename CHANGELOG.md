## Migration Notes

### From v2.x to v3.0.0

SecretScout v3.0.0 is 100% backward compatible with v2.x. Simply update your workflow:

```yaml
# Before (v2)
- uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2

# After (v3)
- uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v3
```

No configuration changes required! See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for detailed migration guide.

### Performance Improvements

Users can expect:
- Faster scan times (especially on first run with caching)
- Lower memory usage
- More reliable PR comments
- Better error messages

### Breaking Changes

None! This is a drop-in replacement.
